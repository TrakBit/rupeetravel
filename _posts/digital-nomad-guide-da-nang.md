## The accidental digital nomad

A few months ago, when browsing through my favorite travel site - google flights, I came across this new route, Delhi to Da Nang. The ticket price was nearly as competitive as a domestic route.

As someone with a remote job, I didn't feel the need to apply for holiday leave. I can travel and work remotely from Da Nang. I can visit most of the tourist sites on weekends.

The Vietnam e-visa is for a month, so why not maximize it? So I decided on a month-long plan to stay and work remotely from Da Nang. It was a relatively long duration for a holiday.

## Time to arm up

I started to equip myself with all cross-border financial tools to make my stay as pleasant as possible:

- zero forex markup credit card
- zero forex markup debit card
- travel insurance
- USD currency notes

## Budget stay or premium experience?

I wanted to have a premium experience. Not interested in the backpack traveler experience (no offense to those who like it). But also something that remained in my budget since the travel plan was month-long.

I started searching for hotels in Da Nang. I knew that if I could contact any hotel, I could negotiate the hotel price. That's cause

Chinese tourists were not traveling to Vietnam due to the lockdown.
It was an off-season for Da Nang tourism.

I only found a hotel called Lavencos. I realized they have a Facebook page and decided to message them there. I quickly got a sweet deal from them for my 26-day stay.

I managed to secure a â‚¹2,000 4-star hotel which included breakfast. The hotel was sea-facing in a high-end neighborhood.
