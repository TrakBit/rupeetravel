## Yes, an Indian passport sucks. We all know that.

My entire Twitter feed is complaints by fellow Indians about how they got rejected for Schengen visas or American tourist visas. Indian passport ranks globally in 85th position as per the Henley passport index.

## Now enter the enlightenment phase

You got only one life to live, and India's passport strength might not improve in your lifetime. So now it's better to acknowledge the reality and focus on what India does offer and how you can leverage it.

So what exactly doe India offer?

- Visa-free access to ample nearby SEA (South East Asian) countries.
- A very comprehensive set of financial tools for cross-border finance.

## How do cards and financial tools matter in traveling?

They do. They make your traveling not only convenient but also affordable. The lower the overhead cost of traveling, the more often you can travel.

### Zero forex credit/debit cards

If you take any random Indian credit/debit card overseas, it can incur forex markup charges on every transaction, which can be as high as 3.5%.

But India has ample competition in the credit/debit card space. You can get zero forex markup credit cards and debit cards, both.

### Travel insurance

Your local health insurance won't pay for the hospital bills that incur overseas. That's why you need travel insurance. They cover your overseas hospital bills at a low price.

For example, my 26 days holiday in Da Nang, Vietnam, was covered by digit insurance for â‚¹1276.
